## UI/UX Principles
- Clean, modern, and minimal interface
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Easy switching between news sources
- Prominent search bar for filtering articles
- Article cards with clear titles, images, and metadata
- Accessible color contrast and focus states

## Tailwind CSS Usage
- All UI is styled using Tailwind utility classes
- Uses light and dark mode (via Tailwind's dark: classes)
- Buttons, inputs, and cards use rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Consistent spacing and typography

## Customization
- To adjust colors, spacing, or breakpoints, edit `styles/globals.css` or Tailwind config
- For new components, follow the pattern in `pages/index.js` for utility-first styling
